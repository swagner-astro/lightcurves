    An object inherited from HopFinder can be used to characterize flares, i.e.
    determine start, peak and end time, based on Bayesian blocks with different methods:

            https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877...39M/abstract
        2. half:
            Start/end is at center of valley block
        3. sharp:
            Neglect valley block
        4. flip:
            Extrapolate flare behavior

    lc_edges:
        a) 'neglect'
            single start and end times are neglected
            incomplete flares (peaks without start or end time) are conservatively neglected
        b) 'add'
            single start and end times are neglected
            if peak has no start/end it is artificially added in beginning/end of light curve
